WHAT IS IT
----------

The goal of the lensfun library is to provide a open source database
of photographic lenses and their characteristics. In the past there
was a effort in this direction (see http://www.epaperpress.com/ptlens/),
but then author decided to take the commercial route and the database
froze at the last public stage. This database was used as the basement
on which lensfun database grew, thanks to PTLens author which gave his
permission for this, while the code was totally rewritten from scratch
(and the database was converted to a totally new, XML-based format).

The lensfun library not only provides a way to read the database
and search for specific things in it, but also provides a set of
algorithms for correcting images based on detailed knowledge of
lens properties. Right now lensfun is designed to correct
distortion, transversal (also known as lateral) chromatic aberrations,
vignetting and colour contribution of the lens (e.g. when sometimes
people says one lens gives "yellowish" images and another, say, "bluish").

The interface is defined both using C++ style and plain C.
The C interface is a wrapper around the C++ classes.

QUICK BUILDING AND INSTALL
--------------------------

For people that just want to quickly build and install the library and
forget it, here goes a quick reference.

To build the library, you must first configure the library and then
build/install it, as usual. In order to successfully configure and
build the project the following tools are more or less required:

	- Python to run the configure script.
	- GNU Make 3.80 or later to run the (rather complex) makefiles.
	- Doxygen in order to generate the library documentation.
	- GLib 2.0 and later which is used for low-level I/O and XML parsing.
	- libpng is required to build and run test programs.

First, configure it almost as usual when you use autoconf-based build systems:

	CFLAGS="..." CXXFLAGS="..." LDFLAGS="..." LIBS="..." \
	./configure --prefix=... [--bindir, --libdir, --sysconfdir, ...] \
		[--staticlibs (by default it builds shared libs)]

If all goes well, you now can enter:

	make install

This will build and install everything required for installation. No separate
build step is required, it will work in just one step.


BUILD SYSTEM IN DEPTH
---------------------

This project does not use autoconf, but the configure script tries to mimic
it to some extent. You can see a list of configure options by typing:

	./configure --help

as usual. After that you can build one or several "modules" (which are
the separate pieces which together form this whole project). To see what
modules are there, type "make" without parameters. For example, to build
all test programs, type:

	make tests

The build system hides the complexity of the commands run under macros like
GCC.CC, GCC.LD and so on, to avoid cluttering the output and let you easily
identify warnings and errors. However, if you're curious to see the full
commands used while building, set the makefile variable "V" to 1, e.g:

	make install V=1

If for some reason you need a static library (by default a shared library is
built), you must use the --staticlibs configure switch, which will force all
shared libraries to be built statically. For example it is more convenient
to debug with static libraries, because you don't have to set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the directory where the shared libraries
are built.

The build system allows quick switching between compiling in debug and
release mode. The default is release mode for those quick guys that just
need to build lensfun as a dependency for something bigger. You can change
the build mode by specifying a value to the MODE makefile variable, e.g:

	make MODE=debug

Another feature of the build system is that it uses a special tool called
makedep to automatically build dependencies. If it is installed in your
system, configure will detect and use that. If not, it will be automatically
built and used. If you don't want this to happen, you must set the AUTODEP
variable to 0:

	make all AUTODEP=0

These are the most important features so far. The build system currently
lacks a complete documentation, but I hope the above info is enough to
productively use it.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The end-user documentation for the library can be built by issuing the
command:

	make docs

Also you can read it online at any time by pointing your browser to:

	http://lensfun.berlios.de/manual/

The documentation on the site is updated every night from SVN, so it always
contains the latest info on the library.
