SYNOPSIS
============

``g-update-lensfun-data``

DESCRIPTION
===============

``g-update-lensfun-data`` is a GUI version of ``update-lensfun-data``.  Both
programs do the same, however, ``g-update-lensfun-data`` will ask for a root
password if needed in a popup window rather than on the command line.  This
way, it comes in handy if a GUI program wants to let the user update lensfun's
database.

See the manpage of ``update-lensfun-data`` for further information, and pay
special attention to the DIAGNOSTICS section.
